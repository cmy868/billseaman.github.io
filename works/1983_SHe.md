        The next period in Seaman's oeuvre employed video as a poetic technological vehicle, exploring sound,
        image and text relations within a slow pulsing hypnotic video space. Both linear tapes and video
        installations were produced. The tapes S.He (1983), Telling Motions (1986), The Water Catalogue (1984)
        (commissioned by the Contemporary Art Television Fund), Shear (1986), and Boxer's Puzzle (1986) with
        Ellen Sebring were produced in this period. (Still available through Electronic Arts Intermix in the US) Central in allmost all of these works was the artist's voice, delivering the text in either spoken or sung form.
