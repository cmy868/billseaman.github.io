<h2>Device for Architectural Inversion</h2>
<h3>Bill Seaman 1979</h3>
</div>
<p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px">
    One simple yet interesting early work was entitled Device for Architectural Inversion (1979). 
    The work was facilitated by the simple technology of a pair of glasses that had two mirrors affixed to the front at 45-degree angles. 
    When a participant wore the glasses, it appeared that they were walking on the ceiling. 
    Thus a strange conflation of actual space with a displacement of actual space was facilitated. 
    The participant experienced an uncanny sense of architectural displacement. 
    Perhaps this work is a proto-Virtual Reality work, or augmented reality through reality displacement.

<p>Key words: proto-virtual reality, proto-augmented reality, displacement, defamiliarization, the uncanny</p>
