The first major interactive work was entitled The Watch Detail (1990). Video images, sound and text that addressed the subject of time were explored interactively. This work employed Macintosh Hypercard media, that was used to control an interactive laserdisc. Thus the work became a meta-media time piece. A large database of time-oriented images, and texts could be navigated, juxtaposed and/or re-oriented in time. The media-time of the image could also be explored where a participant could move forward, backward, stay still, as well as move fast forward and fast backward. An elaborate poetic text made of short individual observations about time was made available to the user of the system. The participant could juxtapose any of the video and still material, move from chapter to chapter, edit segments, trigger sequences of encoded database material in relation to chosen selected textual criteria, view a set of still images with text superimpositions, or view material in a linear mode. A linear video also exists with this title.

<h3>Timebook for The Watch Detail</h3>
<p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px">
A question about duration<br />
Expanded upon for a lifetime.<br />
Take your time.<br />
Calm erodes the longer time is studied.<br />
Through an alternate perspective<br /><br />
Apprehension decays.<br /><br />
Second notice.<br /><br />
Watching being watched.<br /><br />
Time zones.<br />
Lose a day, in still confinement.<br />
Flying at the speed of<br />
Continuous sunrise.<br />
The difference in memories.<br />
Snow falls on silence,<br />
Blue shadow<br />
White on white.<br />
Rest inside slow movements,<br />
Extended gestures.<br />
A set of questions<br />
Released in an open field.<br />
Uncertain conclusions,<br />
Dwelling in the fields of time.<br />
A combination lock<br />
Around a branch at age 15.<br />
The tree envelopes the lock<br />
The definition of eventuality grows<br />
When an analogue clock is unplugged<br />
The time is correct twice a day.<br />
Listen for the clock of flames.<br />
A watched kettle never whistles.<br />
Trees, chain saw sound,<br />
Rings and saw dust.<br />
A clock’s circulatory system,<br />
Floats the duration of a sentence.<br />
A number signals as the clock strikes.<br />
The earth circles another sleep.<br />
The year slides by the sun’s indifference.<br />
The weather seems more intense.<br />
Change the time while no one is looking.<br />
Change the subject.<br />
Whittling away the days.<br />
The space of removal.<br />
Common desk calendars lined the street.<br />
Compression, striations, layers,<br />
Schisms, sink holes.<br />
The way a sound decays.<br />
The way it dies out.<br />
The echo of reflection.<br />
Real.<br />
Fixed.<br />
Set.<br />
Standard.<br />
Lost.<br />
Elapsed.<br />
Variable.<br />
Time out.<br />
A number of clocks in boats<br />
Set adrift.<br />
A number of watches held.<br />
I listen to a number.<br />
The expressions on the face<br />
Of the clock of water<br />
Throuheating and freezing.<br />
Rotating schedules.<br />
No hands.<br />
The illusion of time, the mirage,<br />
Holds pressure in the passing.<br />
Enter into a Red Wood’s<br />
Scale of time.<br />
Spelunking Plato,<br />
Carbide torches,<br />
The clock of fuel.<br />
The distance a wound travels to heal.<br />
Mechanicoy boats<br />
Set adrift.<br />
A number of watches held.<br />
I listen to a number.<br />
The expressions on the face<br />
Of the clock of water<br />
Through listen to a number.<br />
The expressions on the face<br />
Of the clock of water<br />
Through ons on the face<br />
Of the clock of water<br />
Through tion lasts for months...<br />
Leaving at an indeterminate moment.<br />
The slippery nature of<br />
The exact time.<br />
Dealing with a certain discontinuity,<br />
Of always returning to the fear.<br />
The inability to escape the inability.<br />
Early.<br />
Newspaper (yellows).<br />
As if the color of time was a symbol.<br />
Time is an analogy.<br />
All at once the sign board came alive<br />
The destinations and times spun frantically,<br />
Making the sound<br />
Of thousands of little clicks.<br />
Just as fast the board stopped<br />
And a new set of destinations arrived.<br />
Zero degree clock of breathing.<br />
Vapor in a person’s breath.<br />
The duration of evaporation.<br />
Of disappearance.<br />
Late.<br />
A watch without hands.<br />
Routine inspection<br />
For cracks and fatigue.<br />
The young and the old,<br />
All eyes present, observing.<br />
Different starting points..<br />
The perspectives of each.<br />
All ages present in one<br />
with many perspectives.<br />
Time is money.<br />
Time to kill.<br />
Cracks in a sandstone sidewalk.<br />
The odor of a freshly cut lawn.<br />
The shadows of Hiroshima.<br />
The qualities<br />
Of the surfaces that were replaced.<br />
The actuaal rotations of luminous hands.<br />
Attempting to grasp<br />
A dream on the edge of memory.<br />
The architecture of reaction.<br />
A duration.<br />
Nothing sometimes feels substantial.<br />
The building had been torn down.<br />
Solidity and permanence<br />
Now empty. Rendered silent.<br />
A senspring<br />
The shape of memory.<br />
A nose worn shiny through touch<br />
On a bronze statue.<br />
The body tarnished.<br />
The speed of darkness.<br />
The speed of light.<br />
Zero hour.<br />
Impressions are left through<br />
The architecture of impermanence.<br />
When one building is torn down<br />
The duration of a disaster.<br />
The aftermath.<br />
The loss of vital signs.<br />
Another inch and the accident<br />
Would never have happened.<br />
Rubbed lightly.<br />
Formica, sitting day after day.<br />
Worn through.<br />
Fake wood grain<br />
1940, 1950, 1960... version.<br />
The shape of a clock vast area of land burning<br />
Out of control.<br />
The time it has taken...<br />
The time it takes to replace it.<br />
A house of cards falls.<br />
Can you hold?<br />
A sign that has almost<br />
Been removed, almost not there.<br />
The traces of the lettering.<br />
The face of a digital clock<br />
Down without power.<br />
The space of the light blank impressions<br />
Cast in the blink.<br />
The space between these impressions.<br />
A plane crosses stretching and bending<br />
Through waves of light.<br />
The qualities of 200 year old glass,<br />
Adjacent to a fixed window.<br />
A white vapor time line<br />
Across a blue expanse.<br />
What there was<br />
Before the concept,<br />
Before the devices.<br />
Around the clock<br />
Construction, fabrication.<br />
Lost in a work ritual.<br />
Attempting to focus so as to transcend.<br />
A clockwork repetition.<br />
Around the clock<br />
Allowing oneself to<br />
Lose track of the time.<br />
Dwelling<br />
Taking on the air of history.<br />
Sheer fabric wall,<br />
Shear stone face,<br />
Wall of light.<br />
Glass worn round and smooth.<br />
To Sand to Glass to Sand.<br />
The positions of the tide.<br />
Returning.<br />
Over wound.<br />
Winding up / Winding down.<br />
The wind up and the pitch.<br />
Second wind<br />
Wind up winded<br />
Wind up wounded<br />
Wind up lost in thought.<br />
Make good time.<br />
Fingernail dirt, beard growth<br />
Sole taps, dust.<br />
Every moment was articulated<br />
Through a visceral beat.<br />
I could hear my heart through an ear infection<br />
a 1ot been explored.<br />
A day where I would<br />
Attempt to do nothing.<br />
A day spent recalling that day.<br />
Discomfort seems to slow.<br />
A work in abbreviations about longevity<br />
An abbreviation that is<br />
Under construction for a lifetime.<br />
All of the houses one has lived in.<br />
All of the houses one will live in.<br />
The housing of this memory,<br />
Nested and projected.<br />
Fix the time.<br />
Renovation.<br />
We are different ages in memory.<br />
Clockwise, Counter clockwise.<br />
Real time (a realm other than).<br />
A room in wrapped in string at seven.<br />
Reflection.<br />
The nature of focus gives duration<br />
To a chosen element in a field of vision.<br />
Growth drawing<br />
Pencil lines from the tippy top.<br />
A child’s stature.<br />
A measure of change.<br />
Second hand positioning.<br />
Second hand furnishings.<br />
Second hand information.<br />
Second hand clothing.<br />
Second hand words.<br />
Second hand light.<br />
Second thoughts.<br />
Puns and paradoxes.<br />
Quartz and pendulums.<br />
Oscillating constants.<br />
The balance of conclusions.<br />
As many histories<br />
As the perspective of everywhere<br />
One cannot be.<br />
Accumulated subjectivity<br />
Appears to be objective.<br />
The boat is driven in a figure 8,<br />
Over and over.<br />
I am not yet a teen-ager.<br />
The symbol for infinity is drawn in water.<br />
Our slippery hour.<br />
Turning around and about.<br />
The little hand and the big<br />
Exchange places.<br />
The left becomes the right...<br />
The right, the left.<br />
We never see the same thing twice.<br />
A subtle quality of aging.<br />
At 13 the boat is driven<br />
In a circle full speed.<br />
Lines spiral out.<br />
Until the water regains flatness.<br />
The function of forgetting.<br />
A violent event<br />
As seen from this distance.<br />
Define a resonant situation<br />
Where time is concerned.<br />
Where concern is timed.<br />
Inside out.<br />
Collapsed time.<br />
Black holes.<br />
Memory fails.<br />
Time folds.<br />
Clocks are sometimes empty.<br />
The history of nothing is not.<br />
After, (always)<br />
the re-composition of the event.<br />
Unless the event is the act of re-composition.<br />
Second wind.<br />
All of the books on the shelves<br />
One hasn’t read.<br />
Temporary repairs.<br />
Moving music for relativity.<br />
The pitch of passing vehicles.<br />
An ephemeral light event<br />
Arrives unforeseen,<br />
Leaving t book of notice open.<br />
Is there leisure time?<br />
No. But there are leisure suits.<br />
Within the dimensions of a memory.<br />
Just outside<br />
Half-lives.<br />
The time it takes a clock<br />
To run down and stop.<br />
Dice - the quality of the throw,<br />
The call, the roll, the fall.<br />
The  instances<br />
observers<br />
form<br />
The Watch Detail.<br />
The night watchman is only one.<br />
A compression<br />
Or expansion within<br />
A moments notice.<br />
Before and after<br />
Pictures.<br />
The flow of glass.<br />
The decay of wood.<br />
The life of stone.<br />
Resting,<br />
Within the house of time.<br />
An informed sense of probability sings<br />
To the navigation of possibility.<br />
The unknown also sings.<br />
On the road,<br />
The ticking of the broken white line.<br />
Spring rain<br />
Erodes a temporary passage.<br />
A person picks up a stick<br />
And scratches an alternate rut.<br />
The clock of erosion is diverted.<br />
The internal clock of light.<br />
When I hear a song from those years...<br />
November Light<br />
Dusk.<br />
Long Shadows.<br />
Futuristic Car design of 1950.<br />
A broken dashboard clock.<br />
Awkward Clothing.<br />
Burning the candle at both ends,<br />
A circular wick re-invents the wheel.<br />
Night drawings<br />
In passing - bending<br />
Headlights follow<br />
The angles of the walls<br />
The way sound gives clues<br />
To the day.<br />
Cicadas on a white hot day.<br />
The drone of traffic.<br />
The physicality of silence.<br />
Day to day life observes<br />
Lost time.<br />
An average day.<br />
Infinite information<br />
Finite time.<br />
Silence.<br />
Two Loons on a moonless night.<br />
The sound in a vacant house.<br />
Blinds.<br />
Worn stone steps.<br />
Distant highway metal bridge grid work.<br />
Melting ice.<br />
Memory fails.<br />
Breaks down.<br />
Slips.<br />
Senility.<br />
Lost in a moment.<br />
A suspended sense.<br />
When repetition<br />
Breaks down perception.<br />
The scale of time is lost on us.<br />
A watch held.<br />
Left in the street.<br />
Run over and over.<br />
Broken shards<br />
Embedded in tar.<br />
Just lost in the viscous warm black.<br />
A clock from a distance<br />
Just out of range...<br />
Almost real time.<br />
A slight slowdown.<br />
An internal clock sometimes sings<br />
With a note of friction.<br />
Bathing in the light of blue gravity.<br />
Red in the light of evening<br />
Goes on into blue light escaping.<br />
Headlight lit details.<br />
Threshold into black.<br />
Revolving door - counter clockwise<br />
Ever so slightly,<br />
Eventually<br />
The characters were altered.<br />
Speed was more important<br />
Than intricacy.<br />
Her handwriting<br />
Became barely legible,<br />
Against slow words<br />
Hand held.<br />
A shadow<br />
Follows intricate directions.<br />
Attempting to take in<br />
The specifics of the moment.<br />
Night driving trajectories of<br />
Color in light motion.<br />
Night flying over light energy grids.<br />
The qualities of notice<br />
In relation to velocity.<br />
The shadow of a decoy<br />
In artificial light<br />
A drone holds a place<br />
where the scale of time is erased.<br />
Drifting where water is all horizon.<br />
As if sound events were landmarks<br />
For navigation.<br />
Slow light just now reaching<br />
A very distant source.<br />
The speed of a neural response<br />
The velocity of a thought.<br />
The in-between.<br />
From time to time there is<br />
Rapid change.<br />
Temporary repairs...<br />
Masking tape,<br />
Flimsy plastic, etc.<br />
A piece of plywood.<br />
The bottom of the Ford Falcon rusted out.<br />
One could see the road as a blur<br />
through this hole. Age 12.<br />
I become unsure of my age.<br />
Search time.<br />
Watch.<br />
With one hand.<br />
The memory of a diary collecting dust.<br />
An analogy<br />
That sometimes seems<br />
To stands still.<br />
It can never be held.<br />
Still life room<br />
When light streams in.<br />
Dust hovering,<br />
Slowly circulating.<br />
Forgetting the date and day.<br />
The properties are mapped<br />
Onto devices.<br />
A tree merges with a fence<br />
Through growth.<br />
Trees.<br />
Up-rooted after a storm.<br />
The branches removed.<br />
The distance of time<br />
Smoothes the violence of an event.<br />
Black trees after a rain<br />
Lit in bright side light.<br />
A strong early morning wind.<br />
The splitting of a log.<br />
A rusted wedge.<br />
Concentrated energy motion<br />
Breaks the rings<br />
Rust transferred by fingers<br />
Graftings.<br />
Binding the grafts.<br />
Circling the branch.<br />
Reflecting.<br />
Gathering.<br />
Translating the thought.<br />
Into the gesture.<br />
Worn arc<br />
Where a tree<br />
Has blown against a house.<br />
A tree.<br />
The same location.<br />
A set of atmospheres.<br />
A Tree removed, becomes this chair.<br />
This paper, this light.<br />
Stone sanctuary.<br />
Shadow on a sundial.<br />
A carved chess set<br />
Abandoned<br />
In the last position.<br />
A sundial lit at night.<br />
Yard light.<br />
Stalemate.<br />
Sharpening a sense of clarity<br />
The sound of all the clocks<br />
Striking together, slightly off.<br />
Trying to Determine which clock is<br />
Correct by the sound.<br />
A wash of rust down a brick wall.<br />
Copper bleeding across a stone face.<br />
The delicate expression of erosion.<br />
A proximity to a Hotel empty of activity.<br />
The occupants have left traces.<br />
Crystal chandeliers-vacant hall.<br />
Cut granite facade.<br />
Each room holds many stories.<br />
Each story holds many rooms.<br />
From a distance<br />
A tall building speaks eloquently<br />
Through schedules of light.<br />
The perfection of a particular chair.<br />
The way light enters.<br />
Blue housing.<br />
Blue evening light escaping.<br />
Threshold lit by a headlight.<br />
Standing before empty stands.<br />
Scratches around a worn handle.<br />
The gardener’s wrists and hands.<br />
Time lines in leather gloves.<br />
To maintain, to seed, to trim,<br />
Then cutting back.<br />
The dank odor of soil,<br />
Temperature and humidity.<br />
Greenhouse light.<br />
The old rotary push mower.<br />
Walking the lawn spreader.<br />
Fertilizing row by row.<br />
The sound of garden shears<br />
And the electric trimmer.<br />
Watering schedules.<br />
The coiled hose.<br />
Coverage in winter.<br />
Wooden guards stand watch.<br />
Boats in bright blue plastic tarps.<br />
An hourglass resting on it’s side.<br />
The internal mechanism of a clock tower<br />
With moving figures.<br />
Obscured torso.<br />
Someone falters and adjusts.<br />
The gestures that go on inside.<br />
Time lines.<br />
Intersections.<br />
Springs.<br />
Winding motion.<br />
Runway architecture.<br />
Airport lights.<br />
The control tower.<br />
All of the places designated<br />
For observation.<br />
Landing gear.<br />
The moment of deployment.<br />
Breaking the timelessness.<br />
One plane relative to another<br />
Crossing at different altitudes.<br />
Shiny black shoes.<br />
Old black shoes.<br />
A proximity to a person watching.<br />
A group of people looking on<br />
After an accident.<br />
People waiting to see something<br />
Then going about their business.<br />
Someousings of light,<br />
Of luminous hands.<br />
A gold watch,<br />
Silver hair,<br />
Bluing the grey.<br />
Rust, amber and black.<br />
The color of time.<br />
The song of the unknown.<br />
Seeking a resonance<br />
Through many passages.<br />
The voice of clockwork.<br />
The litany of the labyrinth detail.<br />
Maacent structure wears<br />
A past life of stairways,<br />
Rooms, doors, paint, wallpaper.<br />
All of the years of growth<br />
Were removed from a structure<br />
For protection.<br />
The building stands naked.<br />
A timeless odor.<br />
Diamond cutting.<br />
Tree cutting.<br />
Diamond matches<br />
Diamond structure<br />
For protection.<br />
The building stands naked.<br />
A timeless odor.<br />
Diamond cutting.<br />
Tree cutting.<br />
Diamond matches.<br />
Diamond ring.<br />
Sci-fi.<br />
Projections and paths suggesting<br />
The future of difference.<br />
The stillness of a fresh snow,<br />
A shiny black piano and<br />
A wind up metronome.<br />
Just a sec.<br />
When time dysfunctions.<br />
The distance shrunk.<br />
Lightening strikes and lights<br />
A field on fire.<br />
A nd up metronome.<br />
Just a sec.<br />
When time dysfunctions.<br />
The distance shrunk.<br />
Lightening strikes and lights<br />
A field on fire.<br />
Waiting.<br />
Sleep.<br />
The time at the tone will be...<br />
You sound so close.<br />
Biological standard<br />
Internal frame.<br />
The child waits longer<br />
Having lived less.<br />
People who wear watches<br />
Keep time.<br />
The locations of<br />
All the clocks in the city.<br />
A part of memory<br />
That hasHaving lived less.<br />
People who wear watches<br />
Keep time.<br />
The locations of<br />
All the clocks in the city.<br />
A part of memory<br />
That has one obscured / hands fidget.<br />
Hands in pockets.<br />
Keys.<br />
Trying all the keys to see which one fits.<br />
Emotional architectures.<br />
The gestures that go on inside.<br />
