            I have spent the last 30 years exploring new forms of artistic expression and the creative use of computers. During this
            time I have also sought to write texts that would help to elucidate this body of work. Additionally, I have been
            interested in opening up new fields of technological research, in particular in relation to new expressive potentials of
            interactive and generative media. After finishing my Ph.D. I found that I had entered a new “research” phase of my work,
            where I was continuously reading in a transdisciplinary manner, drawing from many different fields to articulate my
            practice and thought. I decided to explore the writing of texts that examined my deepest interests at a particular given
            moment. Each paper was “of itself” and intentionally did not seek to conform to a specific research or artistic genre.
            One overarching continuity of my textual production seeks to unpack a network of relationships between the
            observer/participant and the generative work of art, within a time-based cybernetic loop. I see this as an interactive
            continuum between the digital and the sensual. In particular I have been interested in developing works to explore
            meta-meaning potentials— enabling the introspective observation of thought processes as brought about through
            specifically authored human/machinic systems. More recently, I have been exploring Recombinant Informatics, a
            multi-perspective approach to knowledge production.
