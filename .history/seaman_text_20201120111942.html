        <h1>Navigations — A Multi-perspective Approach</h1>
        <h3>From Recombinant Poetics to Neosentience to Recombinant Informatics</h3>

            <p>
            I have spent the last 30 years exploring new forms of artistic expression and the creative use of computers. During this
            time I have also sought to write texts that would help to elucidate this body of work. Additionally, I have been
            interested in opening up new fields of technological research, in particular in relation to new expressive potentials of
            interactive and generative media. After finishing my Ph.D. I found that I had entered a new “research” phase of my work,
            where I was continuously reading in a transdisciplinary manner, drawing from many different fields to articulate my
            practice and thought. I decided to explore the writing of texts that examined my deepest interests at a particular given
            moment. Each paper was “of itself” and intentionally did not seek to conform to a specific research or artistic genre.
            One overarching continuity of my textual production seeks to unpack a network of relationships between the
            observer/participant and the generative work of art, within a time-based cybernetic loop. I see this as an interactive
            continuum between the digital and the sensual. In particular I have been interested in developing works to explore
            meta-meaning potentials— enabling the introspective observation of thought processes as brought about through
            specifically authored human/machinic systems. More recently, I have been exploring Recombinant Informatics, a
            multi-perspective approach to knowledge production.

                As an artist/researcher I have sought to enfold differing combinations of the following operative foci in both theory
                and practice. This includes: developing new human/machinic approaches to creativity; manifesting new computational
                explorations of poetic image/sound/text interaction through open “navigational” structures; extending the expressive
                potentials of technology through new forms of code authorship; employing combinatorics and embodying database aesthetics
                in a series of generative poetic and now informatic works; articulating new linguistic approaches to knowledge
                production through the notion of fields of meaning; extending the paradigm of human/computer interface potentials;
                authoring systems that articulate different approaches to generative aesthetics; embodying multiple approaches to
                meaning-becoming (meaning production over time); exploring the body, bio-mimetics, and multi-modal sensing and their
                role in meaning production; as well as exploring the re-application of these ideas as an educational methodology and as
                a broad means to generate new knowledge.

                There is no simple way to unpack the intra-operative nature of the above components as they function within my oeuvre.
                They can only be explored as a dynamic, non-linear heterarchy. Likewise, there is no definitive way to parse my papers
                into categories. They each take on one or more of the above foci as part of their enfolded content. Thus, they define a
                rich non-linear network. I can however give the larger concepts that many of these topic areas fall within. Here is a
                potential breakdown of the chapter headings with related texts.
