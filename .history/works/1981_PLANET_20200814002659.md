The work .apt.alt. (1981) explored the creation of a generative text system. For each element in the
periodic table of elements three words were designated. The notion was that any compound could
be used as a kind of algorithm to derive new poems, repeating relevant lines in relation to the
chemical formula. Thus, the system created a form of compound poetry exploring the periodic table of
elements in a literal and metaphorical manner.
