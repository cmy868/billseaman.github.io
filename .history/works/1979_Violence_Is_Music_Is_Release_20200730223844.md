<!-- <h2>Violence Is Music Is Release</h2> -->
<h3>Bill Seaman 1979</h3>
</div>
<p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px;">
This work was performed for a sound art show at SFAI. The audience was positioned on the roof of SFAI 
looking down at the intersection. I had a long metal pipe and walked out onto a triangle. I repeatedly picked up 
the pipe and threw it down as hard as I could. I then marched off the site holding the pipe as one would hold a rifle. 
The sound had a delay as the audience heard the metal rod hit the pavement in relation to the speed of light.
