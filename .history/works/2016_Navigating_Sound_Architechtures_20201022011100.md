        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
The Work "Navigating and Negotiating Sound Architectures of the Night" is
a major evocative multi-media black box theatre work. Its hybrid form includes 3d
architectonic models that are both virtual and physical; digital video; a generative
visual system including 4 real-time projections; 10 live musical improvisers; a
generative soundtrack; a recorded spoken poetic text; and interactive interface
table enabling multiple interactants to explore the work simultaneously.   </p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The work engages with the poetics of night through an interactive structure of 84
            abstract architectural models that are explored over time through multiple sonic /
            architectonic movements; through placement and spatial movement /
            displacement; as well through architectural abstraction. A specially designed
            glass interface table enables participants from the general public to interact with
            the work and become part of the performance via this intuitive multi-user
            interface. A computational sensing system and specially authored computer code
            enables one to juxtapose projection-like texture maps of night-related
            architectural / city-scape imagery, forming large format virtual / architectural
            landscapes presented as 4 large scale projections in the space. Each projection
            contains the view visible from a particular side of the table. A seven movement
            generative/interactive musical score is also driven via the interactive choices of
            the participants; and a series of 10 live audio improvisers also add additional
            layers to the interactive musical score. Multiple architectonic sculptures become
            part of the "set". A poetic text related to the night theme is also enfolded as part
            of the environment. The work is highly interdisciplinary and students from over 5
            departments at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have been participating over the
            course of the year.
