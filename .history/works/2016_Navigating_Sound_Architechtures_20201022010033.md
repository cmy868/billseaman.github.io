    <h2>Overview</h2>
   <p>
The Work "Navigating and Negotiating Sound Architectures of the Night" is<br><br>a major evocative multi-media black box theatre work. Its hybrid form includes 3d<br><br>architectonic models that are both virtual and physical; digital video; a generative<br><br>visual system including 4 real-time projections; 10 live musical improvisers; a<br><br>generative soundtrack; a recorded spoken poetic text; and interactive interface<br><br>table enabling multiple interactants to explore the work simultaneously.<br><br><br><br>Description<br><br>The work engages with the poetics of night through an interactive structure of 84<br><br>abstract architectural models that are explored over time through multiple sonic /<br><br>architectonic movements; through placement and spatial movement /<br><br>displacement; as well through architectural abstraction. A specially designed<br><br>glass interface table enables participants from the general public to interact with<br><br>the work and become part of the performance via this intuitive multi-user<br><br>interface. A computational sensing system and specially authored computer code<br><br>enables one to juxtapose projection-like texture maps of night-related<br><br>architectural / city-scape imagery, forming large format virtual / architectural<br><br>landscapes presented as 4 large scale projections in the space. Each projection<br><br>contains the view visible from a particular side of the table. A seven movement<br><br>generative/interactive musical score is also driven via the interactive choices of<br><br>the participants; and a series of 10 live audio improvisers also add additional<br><br>layers to the interactive musical score. Multiple architectonic sculptures become<br><br>part of the "set". A poetic text related to the night theme is also enfolded as part<br><br>of the environment. The work is highly interdisciplinary and students from over 5<br><br>departments at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have been participating over the<br><br>course of the year.<br><br>Pieces – Physical Interface Units<br><br>Each of the 84 physical interface architectural primitives (physical architectural<br><br>model shapes) are robust in nature — many people interacted with them during<br><br>the performance; each piece is recognized by the system through a unique<br><br>symbol on the bottom of the architectonic form. An additional set of objects can<br><br>be placed next to the models and create architectural abstractions in real time on<br><br>the display screens. This makes the work extremely flexible in terms of real-time<br><br>exploration of architectonic forms and related texture maps. The architectural<br><br>models have been made of many different materials – wood, metal, plastic (3D<br><br>printed) etc. Usability tests were done related to which materials would work<br><br>Best.<br><br><br><br>3d Projection – A set of computer programmers worked in conjunction with<br><br>“Model” designers.<br><br>For each physical piece an isomorphic form was made with 3D modelling<br><br>software. The programmer facilitated “parallel” spatial moves in the “projected<br><br>space” to that of the movement of the object on the interface table. A “Night”<br><br>video landscape was also projected behind the 3d Models/texture maps. Thus a<br><br>kind of 1-1 relation was formed and brought to life via computer code. For each<br><br>piece a set of texture maps was developed.<br><br><br><br>A series of music loops were developed by Seaman before the performance,<br><br>working in tandem with student members contributing sonic materials that were<br><br>folded into the mix. These loops were “attached” by the programmer to each<br><br>object. Each time an architectural model was put down on the table that loop was<br><br>played back in the room. The room reproduced the spatial positioning of the<br><br>objects on the table and as participants moved the objects, their loop moved in<br><br>physical space forming a dynamic real time spatial mix. Each of the 7<br><br>movements had 12 differing loop/objects and functioned as a generative<br><br>soundtrack. Docents delivered the new objects and cleared the table for each<br><br>new movement.<br><br><br><br>When the participant/interactant placed the object on the glass interface surface,<br><br>the image appeared in real time on one of the screens from a particular<br><br>“perspective” that the programmer had authored. Texture maps also appear on<br><br>the surface of the object at that time as presented on the screen. As discussed<br><br>above the sound had a positionality in real space. When the participant moved<br><br>the piece the sound actually moved to a corresponding location in physical<br><br>space. A dynamic relationality of the pieces was thus achieved though both sonic<br><br>and visual spatial means. The goal was to make a working system where many<br><br>pieces could be put on the table and interacted with via multiple interactants<br><br>simultaneously enabling quick dynamic architectural design capabilities — thus<br><br>the work functioned in part as a real-time multi-user “sketching” tool as well as<br><br>artwork generator.<br><br><br><br>Once this goal was achieved, we authored higher level functionalities that related<br><br>to the proximity of one object to another, and/or the functionality of one set of<br><br>objects that could functionally abstract the architectonic qualities of the original<br><br>object – e.g. make differing algorithmic abstractions of the objects including the<br><br>following— making the selected objects bend; multiply; deform or twist; as well<br><br>as make them more or less transparent; change the scale of the objects that are<br><br>projected; and/or change the height of the objects.<br><br><br><br>The Interface Table<br><br>The interface table had a sensing system that read the symbols affixed to each<br><br>object via an infrared camera. The table was robust and inspired in part by the<br><br>initial open source specifications provided by Todd Berreth (Seaman’s<br><br>collaborator at Duke). The table was later fully re-designed by the team. The<br><br>room had 4 major screens as one component of the work each providing a<br><br>differing view of the architectural models covered in texture maps, with an<br><br>additional slow moving/pulsing video texture map as background. This physical<br><br>interface table empowered dialogue between participants standing adjacent to<br><br>the table who in real time manipulated architectural models/projections/sound<br><br>positioning. Over the course of the evening literally hundreds of participants<br><br>explored the system!<br><br><br><br>Being the main focus, the table was placed in the center of the room. The 12’x16’<br><br>screens were placed 8’ above the ground, tilted at an angle that was comfortable<br><br>for audience members to see. The luminous screens together formed a large<br><br>central space that with the table created a space that was the focus of the<br><br>performance, though the participants were allowed to move freely within the<br><br>room. The projectors were placed in the corners of the room, rear projecting onto<br><br>the screens.<br><br><br><br>Live performers in the Space / Generative Audio system<br><br>Pauline Oliveros worked with a group of improvisers who were distributed around<br><br>the edge of the room. This group provided some audio materials to Seaman for<br><br>the construction of the loops. These audio materials consisted of improvisations<br><br>recorded alone and/or in groups; as well as field recordings at night – drones (the<br><br>sound of lights or transformers; cars over the surface of a bridge creating pitches,<br><br>instruments and sung aspects recorded from a distance; Seaman made a<br><br>generative loop system with additional instruments that was designed to work<br><br>together in any generative combination of the architectonic movements. These<br><br>loops were attached to the architectonic “model pieces” described above. As the<br><br>pieces were manipulated on the interface tables individual performers improvised<br><br>with these loops distributed across the space. Thus both the loops and the<br><br>performers had a spatial position in the room. Performers positioned themselves<br><br>in relation to each other – e.g. working closely together to make a certain kinds of<br><br>sound --- and also functioning at a distributed distance to each other.<br><br>To give the performers a defined space, we created canopy structures that hung<br><br>at various heights over the performers. The musicians needed to be able to see<br><br>each other in order to give cues while improvising, and most also needed power<br><br>sources. They also couldn’t be too close, crowding the central table. We spaced<br><br>the performers out around the perimeter to fulfill these requirements. Small<br><br>architectonic enclosures were designed. These canopies were dimly lit to have<br><br>an ambient glow. The table also had a light over it that would come on in<br><br>between each set to signal a new movement.<br><br><br><br>The Changing of the Pieces as a performative element<br><br>I made 12 sonic submixes of these tuned loops for each of the 7 movements –<br><br>one for each object. Thus one series of these loops/objects were brought out and<br><br>placed on the table. These were then completely removed and a new set were<br><br>brought out. Thus new sonic keys and subtle rhythms could be provided over the<br><br>course of the seven movements lasting approximately one hour. In this way we<br><br>could achieve movements in the work – one for each night of the week.<br><br>The goal was to get one set of objects/sounds functioning that produce a selforganizing<br><br>system with variation between the audio work produced via the sonic<br><br>spatial mixing of performers and loops. Once this had been facilitated 6<br><br>additional “sets” were devised and a series of ambient plateau-like sonic states<br><br>functioning at different levels of intensity were authored.<br><br><br><br>Video Materials<br><br>Video images of night both still and moving were recorded by both myself and<br><br>the students. These were reduced to HD for playback (and saved at even lower<br><br>resolutions to function in conjuction with the programmer’s needs in relation to<br><br>the specifications of the numerous texture maps.<br><br><br><br>Poetic Text<br><br>Seaman wrote and recorded a poem which was presented in the space in two<br><br>locations via highly focused speakers from above. Thus, one “found” the poetic<br><br>text while walking around the room. Only when directly under the speaker did the<br><br>poem become part of the mix.<br><br><br><br>Programming<br><br>The programming was built using the Unity engine. Use of both open source and<br><br>new code was explored. A central machine would read the IR video image via a<br><br>camera which was housed in the bottom of the interface table pointing upward;<br><br>and the system processed the symbol token for identity, location and orientation.<br><br>Identity refers to a database that contains, in this case, 3D models, texture maps,<br><br>and sound. Most tokens refered to 3D models but some were modifiers that<br><br>transformed objects that they were adjacent to. The database for modifiers was a<br><br>different one.<br><br><br><br>A central machine communicated the locations of the objects and orientations to<br><br>four other machines, each running a copy of the unity environment. Objects were<br><br>then placed and rendered in each separate system, this enabled the unique<br><br>camera locations to be designated in each case with the coordinated yet unique<br><br>perspectives shown on the large displays above the tables. This process also<br><br>resulted in a system that was robust to glitches/failures during the performance.<br><br>Sound files all run continuously in the background in an initial silent mode.<br><br>Placement and removal of objects on the tables turned up or down volume with<br><br>fast controlled attack and decay envelopes. This allowed the sound files to<br><br>remain coordinated. I have enclosed the coordinated movements 1-7 —this<br><br>generative coordination is achieved by playing back all of the 12 loops for a<br><br>particular movement in sinc. The object’s placement on the table also<br><br>determines the apparent location of the sound within the black-box theatre using<br><br>a novel sound rendering technique by Samuel Chabot/Jonas Braasch detailed in<br><br>the MS Thesis: SPATIALIZED SOUND REPRODUCTION FOR TELEMATIC<br><br>MUSIC PERFORMANCES IN AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.<br><br><br><br>Documentation<br><br>Both still and video documentation of each of the architectonic movements were<br><br>recorded from multiple positions in the space at EMPAC where the work was<br><br>performed. I have enclosed the first 3 minutes of movement 1 as documentation.<br><br>Each movement was similar in structure where the models were delivered, and<br><br>put on the table one at a time. The actual duration of the 7 movements is variable<br><br>but at the moment we have a 54 minute version. The improvisers that played<br><br>along with my generative audio files were students studying under Pauline<br><br>Oliveros. The performance was well attended. Sadly, Pauline Oliveros died<br><br>shortly after this project was completed.<br><br><br><br>Navigating Sound Architectures of the Night<br><br><br><br>Swimming in the night<br><br>In the sound<br><br>Across the lake I hear a loon<br><br>A light shimmers a line of abstraction in reflection<br><br>One can hear the shape of the landscape<br><br>As sounds echo across the night from shore to shore<br><br>Cove to cove<br><br>A sound architecture, a landscape reflection<br><br><br><br>The waves are refracted in the wind of thought<br><br>Transparent light walls speak in muted voices<br><br>I am a child, blindfolding myself in darkness<br><br>Approaching blindness with intention<br><br>The thought of blindness<br><br>To understand<br><br>To learn my reach, my grasp of space<br><br>My bodily limits<br><br><br><br>I learn the room, felt meanings on memories<br><br>A history of relations<br><br>bumping over the glass and the water spills<br><br>So different<br><br>The sound of the heater releasing steam<br><br>I grasp the architecture as I fall in relation to it<br><br><br><br>In a Paris hotel room, I forget the steps having not learned the space<br><br>And returning back in the blackness<br><br>I fall<br><br>I feel the pain of my leg bending back, broken, laying now on the floor<br><br>In the deep black depth of the night<br><br>Waiting patiently for the light<br><br><br><br>The window forms in the distance<br><br>A figure moves across a room<br><br>Color perception diminished<br><br>A perfectly lit room framed by the dusk<br><br>The clarity of the air, a disturbance,<br><br>transmits the light in a crystalline manner<br><br>clearly the dead of winter, extreme cold<br><br>Light illuminates the dance<br><br>Steam forms shape shadows<br><br>as two workman cast a perception of their frames<br><br><br><br>Unknown noises abstracted by distance and wind<br><br>Move in and out of the audible range<br><br>In resonance with the shape of doubt,<br><br>my sense projections filtered<br><br>in the light of the evening’s noise<br><br>at first it appears to be a figure<br><br>I project onto the landscape<br><br>a history of observations<br><br>Into the darkness thought moves<br><br>proximity, a relationality, a false projection<br><br>An illusion of the night<br><br>A quiet disillusionment unfolds<br><br>A poem of light and space<br><br>Speaking of the night<br><br><br><br>The light states are captured in this instance,<br><br>Housed, transformed, and released<br><br>With sound architecture framing these dark transparent meshes<br><br>projected sketches, made of mutable light motions<br><br>These quietly moving forms, form a space of negotiation, of thought passages<br><br>As they play out across the night’s figures and architectural domains<br><br>Where will we end up after these navigations?<br><br>A new place in thought.<br><br><br><br>The chess-like moves have had the rules shifted,<br><br>or removed --- they are open<br><br>So negotiations of light reflect the navigations<br><br>the night sounds are triggered and released, each unfolding a spatial relation<br><br>setting in motion living responses<br><br>reactions flowing<br><br>patterns of resonance transgress the dissonances of darkness<br><br><br><br>Feeling the way around the darkened room<br><br>picturing your face<br><br>From memories of touch<br><br>Eyes closed<br><br>One remembers this touching moment<br><br>The limits of a body of thought – a body of memories<br><br>The light arc of experience<br><br><br><br>I have found my way here navigating negotiations<br><br>Memories of the movements within<br><br>The dark spaces of my nature<br><br>These multiple lives<br><br>in thought and action<br><br>In a vast architecture of darkness,<br><br>Navigating meshed virtualities<br><br>the losses, with sound enterings,<br><br>the back and forth, turning around,<br><br>turning in on itself<br><br>The quiet internal conversation.<br><br>The night is a veil masking true detail<br><br>Again, mistaken in our projections<br><br>overlays<br><br>doubts made palpable<br><br>The architectonic forms of thought<br><br>Are here and gone<br><br>On the tip of the tongue<br><br>behaviors are rendered, remembered.<br><br>The skew embrace<br><br>The body’s positionings in space<br><br>The movements and proximities are navigated<br><br><br><br>In the dark room<br><br>Focused rays render the moment<br><br>Light abstractions, memories and realizations<br><br>Are rendered palpable<br><br>After years of being locked away<br><br>The space of an association is released and meanders<br><br>Open to this negotiation<br><br>This speaking across boundaries<br><br>Triggers<br><br>as the world unfolds in the moment<br><br>Out of these spaces of dark silence.<br><br>These sound architectures<br><br>The architecture of thought and remembrance.<br><br><br><br>
