Using associative imagery, Seaman creates an unsettling world of buildings and objects, devoid of people. Juxtaposing static shots of stone buildings on "sheer" mountain sides with images of empty rooms, a ladder tilted against a wall, and a reflection of a car rounding a curve, Seaman suggests absence, unbalance, and the mystery of the everyday. A pair of hands clasped together, folding and unfolding, links the images together much as Seaman juxtaposes them for the viewer. Scissors on a table echo the "cutting" that is prevalent in Seaman's work, and provide another allusion to the title.
Music/Camera/Editing: Bill Seaman.

Seaman won the Monte Verite Invitational Prize Locarno, Switzerland  and was invited there to make a new work. This is what I made in residence. This work was shot on location. I was playing with the intermingling of different themes and word/image puns. I also included some differing games played with the hands. 

Concepts: word/image puns, effererality of video in relation to stone architecture, abstraction of games played with the hands, architecture, duchampian readymade tropes.
