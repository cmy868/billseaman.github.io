A China of Many Senses / The Action of Breathing As One (video shot in China) - 2009 Linear Video

A China of Many Senses juxtaposes imagery from China's past and present, highlighting the tension of a country rapidly becoming the world's industrial powerhouse, while simultaneously maintaining many of its ancient modes of existence. 

A China of Many Senses (auto-generative mode)
[version 1.0] generative video/audio/text installation
with Todd Berreth
IEEE Visweek 2011 Exhibition, Providence, RI 
custom software written in C++/OpenGL, digital video/audio source material

This generative Virtual Environment draws in part of the video materials from above.

It frames, orders and builds with these materials, using a vocabulary and grammar of designed behaviors and construction typologies, diagramming and displaying the permutations with standard modes of architectural representation. The effect is to create a projected virtual space with a dizzying sense of logic, scale and balance - an imagined organic and built landscape at once both regimentally ordered and colossally haphazard, filled with both epic and intimate construction and permeated with history. 

The artwork is driven by a software engine, written in C++ and OpenGL. In real-time, it recombinately composes a library of disparate elements, video and image content, spoken-word phrases, 3d models and musical passages, into an evocative dynamic collage, media landscape and hyper-constructed assemblage. 

A China of Many Senses specifically explores the aesthetic potential of utilizing standard architectural visualization techniques and an algorithmically modulated, database-driven virtual environment to create a dynamic poetic space, which may provide suggestive and often unexpected insights into an incredibly relevant and interesting contemporary condition.
