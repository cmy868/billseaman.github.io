        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
The Work "Navigating and Negotiating Sound Architectures of the Night" is
a major evocative multi-media black box theatre work. Its hybrid form includes 3d
architectonic models that are both virtual and physical; digital video; a generative
visual system including 4 real-time projections; 10 live musical improvisers; a
generative soundtrack; a recorded spoken poetic text; and interactive interface
table enabling multiple interactants to explore the work simultaneously.   </p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The work engages with the poetics of night through an interactive structure of 84
            abstract architectural models that are explored over time through multiple sonic /
            architectonic movements; through placement and spatial movement /
            displacement; as well through architectural abstraction. A specially designed
            glass interface table enables participants from the general public to interact with
            the work and become part of the performance via this intuitive multi-user
            interface. A computational sensing system and specially authored computer code
            enables one to juxtapose projection-like texture maps of night-related
            architectural / city-scape imagery, forming large format virtual / architectural
            landscapes presented as 4 large scale projections in the space. Each projection
            contains the view visible from a particular side of the table. A seven movement
            generative/interactive musical score is also driven via the interactive choices of
            the participants; and a series of 10 live audio improvisers also add additional
            layers to the interactive musical score. Multiple architectonic sculptures become
            part of the "set". A poetic text related to the night theme is also enfolded as part
            of the environment. The work is highly interdisciplinary and students from over 5
            departments at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have been participating over the
            course of the year.

            <h4>Pieces – Physical Interface Units</h4>
            <p>Each of the 84 physical interface architectural primitives (physical architectural
                model shapes) are robust in nature — many people interacted with them during
                the performance; each piece is recognized by the system through a unique
                symbol on the bottom of the architectonic form. An additional set of objects can
                be placed next to the models and create architectural abstractions in real time on
                the display screens. This makes the work extremely flexible in terms of real-time
                exploration of architectonic forms and related texture maps. The architectural
                models have been made of many different materials – wood, metal, plastic (3D
                printed) etc. Usability tests were done related to which materials would work
                Best.
