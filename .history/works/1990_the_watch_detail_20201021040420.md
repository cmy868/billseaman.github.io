<h2>THE WATCH DETAIL</h2>
<h3>BILL SEAMAN</h3>
<p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px">
The intuitive use of new technology coupled with the creative utilisation of videodisc has lead to an entirely new way of thinking about movie making.  THE WATCH DETAIL interactive videodisc installation is a poetic musing on time. It incorporates texts, a series of literal and metaphorical images related to the passage of time and a musical score, to form a fugue-like network of observations. 
 <br><br>
THE WATCH DETAIL installation consists of one NTSC videodisc, one NTSC video monitor, one Pioneer 4200 videodisc player, a Macintosh computer (MAC 2) equipped with preprogrammed Hypercard software, digital audio loops, videodisc interface, a mouse, a small reverb, a mixer, a stereo amplifier, speakers, a table and chair.  The entire program fits onto two 800K floppy discs.   The linear video material pressed onto the videodisc lasts approximately 1/2 hour.  The disc also contains a still frame library with over 200 entries.
  <br><br>
I was the camera person, off-line editor, and composer of the music as well as the originator of the initial set of concepts for the work.  The music was generated with an Akai S-900 sampler and Yamaha DX7IIXE Synthesizer using Performer software on a Macintosh SE as a sequencer in a home studio environment. Audio Voices for the DX7IIXE were edited with the aid of an Op-Code Voice Editor and Patch Librarian on the Macintosh.
  <br><br>
The work was programmed by myself with Mark Abbate (Videocraft, Boston) as special programming consultant in a Macintosh Hypercard environment.   
  <br><br>
A user-friendly work tation is provided for the viewer.  The participant can sit down in front of two screens - the Macintosh screen and an adjacent video monitor.  A printed set of directions instructs the viewer in the simple operation of the installation.  The viewer is able to explore the videodisc material through an elaborate preprogrammed set of menus on the Macintosh which they access via the mouse.  The viewer can click on any word or image to navigate the material.  Each menu has an information button which when chosen, opens up a screen describing the functions of the given menu choices.
  <br><br>
The Poetics of Time
  <br><br>
THE WATCH DETAIL explores notions of the passage of time in a number of ways;  the work observes the intrinsic history that objects and locations communicate in terms of the physical state in which they have been recorded;  a daily sense of time is registered through the capturing of certain light qualities;  a seasonal sense of time is examined through the presentation of atmospheric / weather conditions;  a geological sense of time is suggested through the inclusion of a rock quarry and geological formations.   The work also contains a series of short poetic texts dealing with the subject of time. These texts qualify and expand on the meanings of the images.  The viewer also experiences their own sense of duration in relation to the time they invest in the work.  The ability of the viewer to control the speed of playback of recorded material makes THE WATCH DETAIL a me ta-time piece.
  <br><br>
The work is divided into a set of categories of observation:
  <br><br>
            1) WOOD <br><br>
            2) STONE   <br><br>
            3) CLOCKS AND WATCHES  <br><br> 
            4) THE AIRPORT   <br><br>
            5) ARCHITECTURE   <br><br>
            6) YARDS, GARDENS  AND GROUNDS  <br><br>       
  <br><br>
Many of these categories overlap and are cross referenced in the work.  The videodisc embodies image sequences that record some of the different states in which these objects / sites can be found. 
  <br><br>
As we live our day to day lives, we come in contact with places and objects which display their own intrinsic sense of history. We rarely follow a piece of wood from its place of origin in a woods to the chair in which we sometimes sit.  A set of visual clues:  scratches, gouges, the style of the chair, an inscribed date, etc. gives us a sense of the objects  place in history.  Our changing sense of time comes from an accumulation of experiences, memories and projections.  THE WATCH DETAIL presents a set of observations which point in a sensual manner to the internal processes of memory and the registering of the passage of time.  The nature of editing -  collecting and correlating images, language, and sound, also abstracts qualities of time.   THE WATCH DETAIL is a poetic maze which provides a mental space for personal association and introspection.  It presents a realm where the viewer can explore the various qualities which the above categories suggest, as well as come in direct contact with the time-oriented exploration of the videodisc medium.      
  <br><br>
The menus allow viewers to experience the sequences of THE WATCH DETAIL in a direct manner.  The longest search time is one second (the amount of time it takes the laser to scan from the beginning to the end of the disc).  Two menus THE MAIN MENU and the ALTERNATE FUNCTION DEVICES menu as well as a series of sub-menus allow the viewer to move through the material in the following manner:
   <br><br>
THE MAIN MENU
   <br><br>
WOOD  <br><br>
STONE  <br><br>
CLOCKS AND WATCHES   <br><br> 
THE AIRPORT    <br><br>
ARCHITECTURE    <br><br>
YARDS, GARDENS AND GROUNDS  <br><br>
ALTERNATE FUNCTIONS MENU  <br><br>
INFORMATION  <br><br>
SPEED CONTROL GLYPHS  <br><br>
 
The viewer is able to move from one category to a different category i.e. from the "WOOD" category to the "STONE" category by choosing (clicking on) different words on the menu with the mouse.  
   <br><br>
The viewer is able to move from one image section to another within a given category, i.e. from one set of 'WOOD' related material to another selection from the 'WOOD' category.  A speed control glyph is one way the viewer can navigate the material on the disc.  The viewer can access disc material at specific playback rates including normal play, differing rates of slow motion both forward and reverse, fast forward and fast reverse, by choosing (clicking on) different glyphs.  The viewer can choose the still frame glyph as well as step through the disc one frame at a time.
   <br><br>
A set of audio loops have been programmed to be called up from computer memory to accompany viewing in slow motion. Usually when viewing slow motion generated by the videodisc player, there is no audio. A different version of the work might incorporate a videodisc and an audio CD (Compact Disc) to accomplish this task with higher fidelity.
    <br><br>
An "INFORMATION" button gives information about different menu choices when selected.
   <br><br>
The viewer can choose "ALTERNATE FUNCTIONS MENU" and a new menu appears entitled "ALTERNATE FUNCTION DEVICES".
   <br><br>
ALTERNATE FUNCTION DEVICES
   <br><br>
FRAGMENT RECOMBINATION EDITOR  <br><br>
COMPOSITE CATEGORY FINDER  <br><br>
TEXT/STILL LIBRARY  <br><br>
TEXT OVERLAYS  <br><br>
PIVOTS  <br><br>
LINEAR  <br><br>
MAIN MENU  <br><br>
INFORMATION  <br><br>
 
Using the "ALTERNATE FUNCTION DEVICES" menu takes the viewer to a series of sub-menus.
   <br><br>
The FRAGMENT RECOMBINATION EDITOR allows the viewer to define their own edit sequence from the videodisc material. They can move anywhere on the disc with a small "MAIN MENU" and the set of speed control glyphs. They then can click on "Begin" and "End" to define a video and sound fragment.  After they have chosen a series of fragments from anywhere on the disc they can hit "ENTER" and view their own edits as a short movie.
   <br><br>
The COMPOSITE CATEGORY FINDER allows the viewer to view one of the many possible composite edits consisting of material in the primary categories.  By selecting a set of specific categories with the mouse, the computer searches for one composite segment which contains an example from each category.  This is facilitated by the coding of each of the edits in the work.  When the viewer makes a choice the computer searches for the first edit containing the appropriate combination of code letters, then searches and plays the single composite fragment. 
   <br><br>
The TEXT/STILL LIBRARY choice leads to a library of over 200 poetic writings about time, superimposed on top of specific image frames.  The viewer can move through the frames one at a time at their own pace, select a random frame, see a slide show, or view all of the frames very quickly.  These texts augment and/or qualify visual material available through the other menus on the disc.   
   <br><br>
The TEXT OVERLAYS menu, allows the viewer to superimpose a similar set of writings to those found in the TEXT/STILL LIBRARY over any image or sequence of images they select on the disc.  The texts, housed and called up from the Macintosh, appear on the video monitor superimposed over the chosen still frame or motion sequence  as well as on the Macintosh screen.   The viewer can move anywhere on the disc and generate their own juxtapositions from the provided material.  This allows for a huge number of chance combinations in terms of language / image relationships.  The texts and images "work" together or make sense in that they relate to each other via their subject matter (time).  The viewer takes an active conceptual role in bridging the metaphorical distance between image and text developing their own projected set of relations.
   <br><br>
The PIVOTS menu allows the participant to view edits from a set of categories by clicking the mouse.  An edit sequence might consist of an image of wooden floors, a pocket watch, a stone quarry, a plane taking off in the distance...  These sequences are constructed utilizing edit fragments from all of the categories found on the MAIN MENU.  Again, each edit on the disc has been codified.  As the viewer makes a selection, the computer searches for an example that fits the chosen category.  If the viewer chooses that set of categories again, the computer searches for an alternate set of selections.      
   <br><br>
The selection of LINEAR plays the set of main categories from beginning to end the way it is laid out on the disc, in real time. 
   <br><br>
The participant is given the opportunity to navigate the material presented in THE WATCH DETAIL at their own rate and to repeat the viewing of chosen sections if desired.  The viewer is able to watch the material at different playback rates and explore the various qualities of time oriented videodisc manipulation.  Thus the viewer explores a poly-linear maze of language, image and music relations, which in turn deal with the poetic nature of time.  The viewer essentially constructs their own video experience based on a personal set of decisions.  It is the layered fusing of these time oriented observations into a poetic video maze as well as the chance juxtaposition of specific elements, which make THE WATCH DETAIL a distinctive interactive project.

A past life of stairways,<br>
Rooms, doors, paint, wallpaper.<br>
All of the years of growth<br>
Were removed from a structure<br>
For protection.<br>
The building stands naked.<br>
A timeless odor.<br>
Diamond cutting.<br>
Tree cutting.<br>
Diamond matches<br>

Sci-fi.<br>
Projections and paths suggesting<br>
The future of difference.<br>
The stillness of a fresh snow,<br>
A shiny black piano and<br>
A wind up metronome.<br>
Just a sec.<br>
When time dysfunctions.<br>
The distance shrunk.<br>
Lightening strikes and lights<br>
A field on fire.<br>
A nd up metronome.<br>
Just a sec.<br>
When time dysfunctions.<br>
The distance shrunk.<br>
Lightening strikes and lights<br>
A field on fire.<br>
Waiting.<br>
Sleep.<br>
The time at the tone will be...<br>
You sound so close.<br>
Biological standard<br>
Internal frame.<br>
The child waits longer<br>
Having lived less.<br>
People who wear watches<br>
Keep time.<br>
The locations of<br>
All the clocks in the city.<br>
A part of memory<br>
That hasHaving lived less.<br>
People who wear watches<br>
Keep time.<br>
The locations of<br>
All the clocks in the city.<br>
A part of memory<br>
That has one obscured / hands fidget.<br>
Hands in pockets.<br>
Keys.<br>
Trying all the keys to see which one fits.<br>
Emotional architectures.<br>
The gestures that go on inside.<br>
