One Pulls Pivots At The Tip Of The Tongue is a series of selections from my writings that date from 1979 to 1981.  Each observation notated represents one selection and is typed onto a slip of paper.  These slips are placed in a container.  The selections are thoroughly mixed, drawn one at a time and retyped in the sequence pulled.  The resulting manuscript forms a chapter without punctuation between the individual selections (the only punctuation is that which appears within any given selection).  The same process is followed to form subsequent chapters.
<br><br>
The final chapter is another random drawing of the selections.  The only difference is that the selections are separated by double slash marks ( // ). This demarcation allows the viewer / participant the opportunity to continue the chance placement process and create new chapters infinitely.
<br><br>
Any new chapters should be inserted so that the final chapter remains in that position.

Key Concepts: generative literature, textual displacement, linguistic collisions, notes and observations
