    <p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px">Red Dice / Des Chiffré (2000) was commissioned by the Canadian National Gallery and is now in their permanent collection. Seaman again worked with Chris Ziegler on the programming of the work. The work presents a text by the Poet Stéphane Mallarmé - Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard, Dice Thrown Never Will Annul Chance, and an interactive audio/visual meta-text by Seaman. Large scale projections of both the interface and the visual portion of Seaman's audio/visual work are presented. The piece enables the user to view and listen to Mallarmé's text through the use of a Pen/Wacom tablet interface. When the pen touches on words, they are subsequently spoken. Small video icons are called up that register the potential to trigger related segments of an audio/visual text by Seaman. The work also incorporates a "Recombinant" section enabling the user to re-order Seaman's video, generate a new soundtrack by choosing from 144 different musical sections - layering up to seven at a time, as well as recombine Seaman's texts via this pen interface. The work functions as a companion work to Passage Sets / One Pulls Pivots at the Tip of the Tongue which was also influenced by the Mallarmé text.</p>

Exchange Fields (2000), commissioned by the Vision
Ruhr Exhibition in Dortmund Germany, incorporates
the recorded dance and choreography of Regina van
Berkel. The programmer Gideon May also became
involved in this project. The central question
dealt with the generation of a new kind of
interface - how might an embodied experience of
interface be layered into the content of an
interactive media/dance comprised of video, text, a
sculptural installation and music? Exchange Fields
sought to develop a novel interface strategy by
eliciting culturally determined environmental
'behavior in relation to objects' as a grammar of
gesture that could be used as input to the reacting
system. The work sought to tap into pre-linguistic/
linguistic environmental knowledge related to the
use of particular varieties of objects. A series of
furniture/sculptures were developed. Each
furniture/sculpture was designed with a unique
implied "suggestion" of how the body might be
positioned in relation to that object. This
suggestion was non-logo-centric. It was embodied in
the form of the physical interface itself and
reinforced through linguistic captioning affixed
near the work.
<br>
<br>
A dynamic relation is experienced by the
participant that is brought about through their
embodied physical positioning. This "gesture"
functions as an input into a computerized system
that dynamically links output consisting of prerecorded
performance/dance images (video) and
sound. These have been choreographed in relation to
the particularity of that embodied position. For
each unique furniture/sculpture a set of related
dances was recorded. A linear text and musical
composition become layered with the sound and image
that is triggered by users. It is the physical
engagement of the participant relative to the
visual and audible output that gives the work its
artistic experiential content and power.
