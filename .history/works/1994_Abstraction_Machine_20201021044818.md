A hotel a room was set aside for installations. I inverted the security eye piece so one could look into the room from the hallway. Just inside the door I placed a computer at eye level so the screen was the only thing visible in the room. It was playing back a generative text. It would take one word or words from each section [one set from the lists 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] forming a sequential poem, then starting the process again, repeating for the entire duration of the installation.
