<h2>Making A Path where Before There was None,</h2>
<h2>An Ode To The Pensive Artist</h2>
<h3>Bill Seaman 1978</h3>
<p style="line-height:25px; font-size: 18px">
    This was a work done in conjunction with Chris Burden’s class, the class he taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. 
    <br>
    I set up two stakes and walked back and forth for 8 hours. A path was literally worn. 
    <br>
    I was intereste, in displaying both a seriousness and a sense of Humor . The reference to the “Ode” also pointed to it as a pro-musical score – a kind of sung poem (made in deference to Silence – Cage’s 4’33”)

    Later, DNA  Hoover, a close friend, filled in the path and technically erased it. We often refer to the Erased DeKooning Drawing that Rauchenberg had done in 1953 as a comparative work (to that of Hoover).
