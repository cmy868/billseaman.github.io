    THIS WORK WAS CO-DEVELOPED WITH THE NEW MUSIC AMERICA FESTIVAL AND
    METRO-DADE ART IN PUBLIC PLACES TRUST
    <br><br>
    Seaman made a series of large format posters to be hung in each of the rapid transit train stations on the metro rail line. Each sign had one statement: Notice the sound of ……… As people would pass by they might see one of the signs. Seaman made samples out of the suggested sounds and then made music from those samples. The signs advertised when radio broadcasts of Seaman’s music would take place. Thus the work explored both event scores (the signs), music, and the listening of the participant in different contexts. One sign contained all of the event scores. Seaman made a spoken word work out of this text presented on the radio as an introduction to the work.

    Concepts: event scores, art in public places, non-gallery art, modes of participation/listening, distributed poetics, linked radio broadcasts.
