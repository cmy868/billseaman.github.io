        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
The Work "Navigating and Negotiating Sound Architectures of the Night" is
a major evocative multi-media black box theatre work. Its hybrid form includes 3d
architectonic models that are both virtual and physical; digital video; a generative
visual system including 4 real-time projections; 10 live musical improvisers; a
generative soundtrack; a recorded spoken poetic text; and interactive interface
table enabling multiple interactants to explore the work simultaneously.   </p>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The work engages with the poetics of night through an interactive structure of 84
            abstract architectural models that are explored over time through multiple sonic /
            architectonic movements; through placement and spatial movement /
            displacement; as well through architectural abstraction. A specially designed
            glass interface table enables participants from the general public to interact with
            the work and become part of the performance via this intuitive multi-user
            interface. A computational sensing system and specially authored computer code
            enables one to juxtapose projection-like texture maps of night-related
            architectural / city-scape imagery, forming large format virtual / architectural
            landscapes presented as 4 large scale projections in the space. Each projection
            contains the view visible from a particular side of the table. A seven movement
            generative/interactive musical score is also driven via the interactive choices of
            the participants; and a series of 10 live audio improvisers also add additional
            layers to the interactive musical score. Multiple architectonic sculptures become
            part of the "set". A poetic text related to the night theme is also enfolded as part
            of the environment. The work is highly interdisciplinary and students from over 5
            departments at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have been participating over the
            course of the year.
            </p>
            <h4>Pieces – Physical Interface Units</h4>
            <p>Each of the 84 physical interface architectural primitives (physical architectural
                model shapes) are robust in nature — many people interacted with them during
                the performance; each piece is recognized by the system through a unique
                symbol on the bottom of the architectonic form. An additional set of objects can
                be placed next to the models and create architectural abstractions in real time on
                the display screens. This makes the work extremely flexible in terms of real-time
                exploration of architectonic forms and related texture maps. The architectural
                models have been made of many different materials – wood, metal, plastic (3D
                printed) etc. Usability tests were done related to which materials would work
                Best.
                </p>
            <h4>3d Projection – A set of computer programmers worked in conjunction with
                “Model” designers.</h4>
            <p>For each physical piece an isomorphic form was made with 3D modelling
                software. The programmer facilitated “parallel” spatial moves in the “projected
                space” to that of the movement of the object on the interface table. A “Night”
                video landscape was also projected behind the 3d Models/texture maps. Thus a
                kind of 1-1 relation was formed and brought to life via computer code. For each
                piece a set of texture maps was developed.
                <br><br>
                A series of music loops were developed by Seaman before the performance,
                working in tandem with student members contributing sonic materials that were
                folded into the mix. These loops were “attached” by the programmer to each
                object. Each time an architectural model was put down on the table that loop was
                played back in the room. The room reproduced the spatial positioning of the
                objects on the table and as participants moved the objects, their loop moved in
                physical space forming a dynamic real time spatial mix. Each of the 7
                movements had 12 differing loop/objects and functioned as a generative
                soundtrack. Docents delivered the new objects and cleared the table for each
                new movement.
                <br><br>
                When the participant/interactant placed the object on the glass interface surface,
                the image appeared in real time on one of the screens from a particular
                “perspective” that the programmer had authored. Texture maps also appear on
                the surface of the object at that time as presented on the screen. As discussed
                above the sound had a positionality in real space. When the participant moved
                the piece the sound actually moved to a corresponding location in physical
                space. A dynamic relationality of the pieces was thus achieved though both sonic
                and visual spatial means. The goal was to make a working system where many
                pieces could be put on the table and interacted with via multiple interactants
                simultaneously enabling quick dynamic architectural design capabilities — thus
                the work functioned in part as a real-time multi-user “sketching” tool as well as
                artwork generator.
                <br><br>
                Once this goal was achieved, we authored higher level functionalities that related
                to the proximity of one object to another, and/or the functionality of one set of
                objects that could functionally abstract the architectonic qualities of the original
                object – e.g. make differing algorithmic abstractions of the objects including the
                following— making the selected objects bend; multiply; deform or twist; as well
                as make them more or less transparent; change the scale of the objects that are
                projected; and/or change the height of the objects.
                </p>
                <h4>The Interface Table</h4>
                <p>
                    The interface table had a sensing system that read the symbols affixed to each object via an infrared camera. The table was robust and inspired in part by the
                    initial open source specifications provided by Todd Berreth (Seaman’s
                    collaborator at Duke). The table was later fully re-designed by the team. The
                    room had 4 major screens as one component of the work each providing a
                    differing view of the architectural models covered in texture maps, with an
                    additional slow moving/pulsing video texture map as background. This physical
                    interface table empowered dialogue between participants standing adjacent to
                    the table who in real time manipulated architectural models/projections/sound
                    positioning. Over the course of the evening literally hundreds of participants
                    explored the system!
                    <br><br>
                    Being the main focus, the table was placed in the center of the room. The 12’x16’
                    screens were placed 8’ above the ground, tilted at an angle that was comfortable
                    for audience members to see. The luminous screens together formed a large
                    central space that with the table created a space that was the focus of the
                    performance, though the participants were allowed to move freely within the
                    room. The projectors were placed in the corners of the room, rear projecting onto
                    the screens. </p>
                    <h4>Live performers in the Space / Generative Audio system</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pauline Oliveros worked with a group of improvisers who were distributed around
                        the edge of the room. This group provided some audio materials to Seaman for
                        the construction of the loops. These audio materials consisted of improvisations
                        recorded alone and/or in groups; as well as field recordings at night – drones (the
                        sound of lights or transformers; cars over the surface of a bridge creating pitches,
                        instruments and sung aspects recorded from a distance; Seaman made a
                        generative loop system with additional instruments that was designed to work
                        together in any generative combination of the architectonic movements. These
                        loops were attached to the architectonic “model pieces” described above. As the
                        pieces were manipulated on the interface tables individual performers improvised
                        with these loops distributed across the space. Thus both the loops and the
                        performers had a spatial position in the room. Performers positioned themselves
                        in relation to each other – e.g. working closely together to make a certain kinds of
                        sound --- and also functioning at a distributed distance to each other.
                        To give the performers a defined space, we created canopy structures that hung
                        at various heights over the performers. The musicians needed to be able to see
                        each other in order to give cues while improvising, and most also needed power
                        sources. They also couldn’t be too close, crowding the central table. We spaced
                        the performers out around the perimeter to fulfill these requirements. Small
                        architectonic enclosures were designed. These canopies were dimly lit to have
                        an ambient glow. The table also had a light over it that would come on in
                        between each set to signal a new movement.

                    </p>
                    <h4>The Changing of the Pieces as a performative element</h4>
                    <p>
                        I made 12 sonic submixes of these tuned loops for each of the 7 movements –
                        one for each object. Thus one series of these loops/objects were brought out and
                        placed on the table. These were then completely removed and a new set were
                        brought out. Thus new sonic keys and subtle rhythms could be provided over the
                        course of the seven movements lasting approximately one hour. In this way we
                        could achieve movements in the work – one for each night of the week.
                        The goal was to get one set of objects/sounds functioning that produce a selforganizing
                        system with variation between the audio work produced via the sonic
                        spatial mixing of performers and loops. Once this had been facilitated 6
                        additional “sets” were devised and a series of ambient plateau-like sonic states
                        functioning at different levels of intensity were authored.                       
                    </p>
                    <h4>Video Materials</h4>
                    <p>Video images of night both still and moving were recorded by both myself and
                        the students. These were reduced to HD for playback (and saved at even lower
                        resolutions to function in conjuction with the programmer’s needs in relation to
                        the specifications of the numerous texture maps.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Programming</h4>
                    <p>
The programming was built using the Unity engine. Use of both open source and
new code was explored. A central machine would read the IR video image via a
camera which was housed in the bottom of the interface table pointing upward;
and the system processed the symbol token for identity, location and orientation.
Identity refers to a database that contains, in this case, 3D models, texture maps,
and sound. Most tokens refered to 3D models but some were modifiers that
transformed objects that they were adjacent to. The database for modifiers was a
different one.

A central machine communicated the locations of the objects and orientations to
four other machines, each running a copy of the unity environment. Objects were
then placed and rendered in each separate system, this enabled the unique
camera locations to be designated in each case with the coordinated yet unique
perspectives shown on the large displays above the tables. This process also
resulted in a system that was robust to glitches/failures during the performance.
Sound files all run continuously in the background in an initial silent mode.
Placement and removal of objects on the tables turned up or down volume with
fast controlled attack and decay envelopes. This allowed the sound files to
remain coordinated. I have enclosed the coordinated movements 1-7 —this
generative coordination is achieved by playing back all of the 12 loops for a
particular movement in sinc. The object’s placement on the table also
determines the apparent location of the sound within the black-box theatre using
a novel sound rendering technique by Samuel Chabot/Jonas Braasch detailed in
the MS Thesis: SPATIALIZED SOUND REPRODUCTION FOR TELEMATIC
MUSIC PERFORMANCES IN AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.

                    <h4>Documentation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Both still and video documentation of each of the architectonic movements were
                        recorded from multiple positions in the space at EMPAC where the work was
                        performed. I have enclosed the first 3 minutes of movement 1 as documentation.
                        Each movement was similar in structure where the models were delivered, and
                        put on the table one at a time. The actual duration of the 7 movements is variable
                        but at the moment we have a 54 minute version. The improvisers that played
                        along with my generative audio files were students studying under Pauline
                        Oliveros. The performance was well attended. Sadly, Pauline Oliveros died
                        shortly after this project was completed.

               <p>
                Swimming in the night
                In the sound
                Across the lake I hear a loon
                A light shimmers a line of abstraction in reflection
                One can hear the shape of the landscape
                As sounds echo across the night from shore to shore
                Cove to cove
                A sound architecture, a landscape reflection
                <br><br>
                The waves are refracted in the wind of thought
                Transparent light walls speak in muted voices
                I am a child, blindfolding myself in darkness
                Approaching blindness with intention
                The thought of blindness
                To understand
                To learn my reach, my grasp of space
                My bodily limits
                <br><br>
                I learn the room, felt meanings on memories
                A history of relations
                bumping over the glass and the water spills
                So different
                The sound of the heater releasing steam
                I grasp the architecture as I fall in relation to it
                <br><br>
                In a Paris hotel room, I forget the steps having not learned the space
                And returning back in the blackness
                I fall
                I feel the pain of my leg bending back, broken, laying now on the floor
                In the deep black depth of the night
                Waiting patiently for the light
                <br><br>
                The window forms in the distance
                A figure moves across a room
                Color perception diminished
                A perfectly lit room framed by the dusk
                The clarity of the air, a disturbance,
                transmits the light in a crystalline manner
                clearly the dead of winter, extreme cold
                Light illuminates the dance
                Steam forms shape shadows
                as two workman cast a perception of their frames
                <br><br>
                Unknown noises abstracted by distance and wind
                Move in and out of the audible range
                In resonance with the shape of doubt,
                my sense projections filtered
                in the light of the evening’s noise
                at first it appears to be a figure
                I project onto the landscape
                a history of observations
                Into the darkness thought moves
                proximity, a relationality, a false projection
                An illusion of the night
                A quiet disillusionment unfolds
                A poem of light and space
                Speaking of the night
                <br><br>
                The light states are captured in this instance,
                Housed, transformed, and released
                With sound architecture framing these dark transparent meshes
                projected sketches, made of mutable light motions
                These quietly moving forms, form a space of negotiation, of thought passages
                As they play out across the night’s figures and architectural domains
                Where will we end up after these navigations?
                A new place in thought.
                <br><br>
                The chess-like moves have had the rules shifted,
                or removed --- they are open
                So negotiations of light reflect the navigations
                the night sounds are triggered and released, each unfolding a spatial relation
                setting in motion living responses
                reactions flowing
                patterns of resonance transgress the dissonances of darkness
                <br><br>
                Feeling the way around the darkened room
                picturing your face
                From memories of touch
                Eyes closed
                One remembers this touching moment
                The limits of a body of thought – a body of memories
                The light arc of experience
                <br><br>
                I have found my way here navigating negotiations
                Memories of the movements within
                The dark spaces of my nature
                These multiple lives
                in thought and action
                In a vast architecture of darkness,
                Navigating meshed virtualities
                the losses, with sound enterings,
                the back and forth, turning around,
                turning in on itself
                The quiet internal conversation.
                The night is a veil masking true detail
                Again, mistaken in our projections
                overlays
                doubts made palpable
                The architectonic forms of thought
                Are here and gone
                On the tip of the tongue
                behaviors are rendered, remembered.
                The skew embrace
                The body’s positionings in space
                The movements and proximities are navigated
                <br><br>
                In the dark room
                Focused rays render the moment
                Light abstractions, memories and realizations
                Are rendered palpable
                After years of being locked away
                The space of an association is released and meanders
                Open to this negotiation
                This speaking across boundaries
                Triggers
                as the world unfolds in the moment
                Out of these spaces of dark silence.
                These sound architectures
                The architecture of thought and remembrance.
