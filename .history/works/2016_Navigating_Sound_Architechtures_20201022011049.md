        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
The Work "Navigating and Negotiating Sound Architectures of the Night" is
a major evocative multi-media black box theatre work. Its hybrid form includes 3d
architectonic models that are both virtual and physical; digital video; a generative
visual system including 4 real-time projections; 10 live musical improvisers; a
generative soundtrack; a recorded spoken poetic text; and interactive interface
table enabling multiple interactants to explore the work simultaneously.   </p>
